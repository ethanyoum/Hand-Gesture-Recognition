## Introduction

Since COVID-19, online meetings and remote work have become one of the main ways of working. Remote access provides an opportunity for disabled people to be employed without having to deal with access barriers often present in the physical workplace environment. However, for individuals with disabilities, direct interaction can be challenging, as not every participant understands gesture meanings. Imagine a scenario where a team is collaborating with a deaf and mute individual. While they can understand others through live captioning, it can be challenging to comprehend what they want to express immediately. Besides, for general users, using gestures to perform actions like raising hands, muting/unmuting, or controlling slides enhances virtual meeting productivity.

Online platforms like Zoom could support gesture recognition, translating real-world gestures into Zoom’s existing reactions. However, this function only supports Raise Hand and Thumbs Up reactions now. This problem has significant practical relevance and potential business applications in other fields like the Automotive Industry-Implementing gesture controls for in-car infotainment systems, improving driver safety. Smart Home Devices- Enabling gesture-based control for various home automation systems.

The dataset contains hand gesture data collected using the Leap Motion Controller, which captures precise hand and finger movements. It includes 10 different gestures performed by 10 subjects, with each gesture repeated multiple times. The data consists of various hand features such as palm position, finger position, and hand orientation.

## Data Preprocessing
Load Images and Normalize: Loaded the raw images from the dataset directory and normalized pixel values to the range [0, 1] or standardized using a mean and standard deviation (e.g., transforms. Normalize in PyTorch) to ensure consistent input distributions for the model.
Shuffle the Dataset: Shuffled the dataset to avoid patterns during training, ensuring that batches contained diverse samples. This step is critical for generalization and reducing model bias.
Perform Image Augmentation: Applied augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, scaling, and cropping to increase the dataset size and introduce variability artificially. These augmentations help the model generalize unseen data better by simulating different real-world scenarios.

## Data Splitting
Train-Test Split: Divided the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data. Ensured a representative split while maintaining class distributions.
Batch Creation: Created mini-batches of data using DataLoader, specifying batch sizes for training and evaluation. Multiprocessing (num_workers) was included for faster data loading.

## Predictive Modeling
For establishing a benchmark model in my analysis, I selected the VGG-16 architecture as a reference point. To evaluate its performance comprehensively, I conducted a comparative analysis against two alternative models: the ResNet architecture, known for its deep residual learning framework, and a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which was specifically designed and fine-tuned to optimize performance for the given dataset. This comparison aimed to assess the strengths and limitations of each model in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalization capability.
